            <p>&emsp;Hi my name is Tristen J Hum. My friends just call me Tj. I was born and raised in Rhode Island. I love to play video games and go to the gym. I like to think of myself as an athlete but I am actually a huge nerd. I've recently developed a gambling addiction stemming from getting my heartbroken. I think I may actually be the best blackjack player that anyone in Rhode Island knows to be fairly honest. I wrestled in high school and currently train in Muay Thai. I also play volleyball every Thursday at the rec center with my friends who play for their schools. </p>
            <br>
            <p>&emsp;I absolutely hate going to school and honestly am only going because my desire to be rich outweighs my hate for school. I've been coding since 8th grade when I learned HTML originally. After that class I never touched HTML again even when I took JavaScript from URI eCampus in my senior year of high school. My mom says I'm too smart for my own good because I can easily pass without trying but I literally don't try on purpose and then I end up like I am now on academic probation. But a passing grade is a passing grade. *Queue Shoulder shrug* I also don't think my Python professor liked me because I skipped his class for 4 weeks and aced both of his finals. </p>
